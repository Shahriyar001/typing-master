                            Local Storage: This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s local
                            storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to
                            sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that
                            is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed
                            (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).
                            Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property. The
                            difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not
                            expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends.

                            The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global
                            variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from
                            any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
                            Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope
                            of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                            conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables
                            from within the curly brackets {}.

                            As a JavaScript developer, it becomes increasingly important to understand what really
                            happens under the hood and how most of these complexities abstracted from us really work. It
                            helps us make more informed decisions, which can, in turn, boost our code performance
                            drastically.

                            This article focuses on one of the very important but seldom understood concepts or terms in
                            JavaScript. The EVENT LOOP!.

                            Writing asynchronous code can not be avoided in JavaScript, but why does a code running
                            asynchronously really mean? i.e. The Event Loop

                            Before we can understand how the event loop works, we first have to understand what
                            JavaScript itself is and how it works!

                            <strong>Template strings</strong> are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in
                            ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to
                            concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are
                            complex and contain dynamic elements.
                            <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
